# 42 - Python Discovery Piscine

>Welcome to the discovery pool of computer programming! This experience aims to introduce you to the fundamentals of coding in Python while embracing peer-learning, the core educational model of 42.
>
>Key Concepts:
>
>    Programming & Logic: Coding is about assembling logical elements, not math. You will build solutions by combining basic "bricks" (instructions) to create functional programs. There is no single correct answer—each solution is unique.
>
>Learning through Exploration: Rather than following predefined steps, you'll explore, experiment, and test your ideas. Collaborating with peers and exchanging insights will help you develop your own approach to solving problems.
>
>Peer-Evaluation: Reviewing each other's work is a crucial step. It exposes you to diverse solutions and potential edge cases, improving the robustness of your code. Each peer evaluator will offer new perspectives, simulating the experience of working with different clients.
>
>Everyone's path in this pool will be different. You’ll choose which challenges to tackle, discover your own solutions, and validate your projects in your unique way.
